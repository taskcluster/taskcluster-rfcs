## Follow-up items for RFC 0190

- Update scope section to align with existing `queue:create-task:<priority>:<taskQueueId>` scopes (or equivalent `queue:change-priority` wording) so scope escalation concerns are addressed.
- Document how reruns inherit an overridden priority and what queue changes are required to persist the updated value across runs.
- Clarify event payloads for task-group priority changes so consumers can discover all affected tasks.
- Add coordination note for updating `scriptworker` (and other chain-of-trust validators) to ignore `priority` changes.
- Flesh out the Implementation section with schema/DB updates, API wiring, event emission, and auth changes.
