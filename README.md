# TaskCluster RFCs


## Background

**What**: Ideas and projects of the TaskCluster Team, in one discoverable place.

**Why**: This repo serves as a place to coordinate design and architecture, so that everyone can participate and past discussions are accessible to everyone.

**How** Proposed RFCs go into [pull requests](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pulls), and [the repo](rfcs/) holds RFCs on which we have reached consensus.
See [mechanics](mechanics.md) for more detail.
