# RFC 0190 - Queue change task / task group priority
* Comments: [#0190](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pull/190)
* Proposed by: @lotas

## Summary

Since we refactored queue internals it became possible to see what tasks are pending for a particular
worker pool / task queue.

This RFC proposes a new API method that would allow changing the priority of the existing task run / task group.

## Motivation

There might be several use-cases when some worker pool has a lot of pending tasks and there is a need
to move some more important tasks to the top of the waiting list, or also move down less important ones.

Instead of cancelling some existing tasks we can change task run priorities.

Use-case examples:

* We have a high-priority patch running tasks on Try. We want to bump the priority of all tasks in this task group
* We have a chemspill release or high priority nightly to get out. We want to bump the priority of all tasks in one or more groups
* We are waiting for a specific task in a low resource pool (eg: mac hardware). We want to bump the priority of that specific task
* There are several tasks with the same highest priority and one of them is more important. We want to lower the priority of the less important task

## Details

Queue service will expose new methods:

* `queue.changeTaskPriority(taskId, newPriority)`
* `queue.changeTaskGroupPriority(taskGroupId, newPriority)`

New priority would replace the original one for a given task or all tasks within the task group.

The process to change single task will be as follows:

* new task priority will be stored in the database as `task.priority` (overriding existing value)
* additionally, if task was scheduled already, its priority will be updated in the `queue_pending_tasks` table

The process to change the whole task group will be as follows:

* all tasks in the task group will be updated to store the new priority in the `task.priority` column
* additionally, all currently scheduled tasks would be attempted to be updated in the `queue_pending_tasks` table

Tasks would only be updated if they are not resolved yet and before their deadlines.

> **Note**: To allow changing the priority of the task without breaking CoT validations, it would be necessary to add `"priority"` to the [`ignore_keys`](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker/blob/454c4dd0bae7958140ea8d19adf3670e705ace09/src/scriptworker/cot/verify.py#L910)

### Events

Since Taskcluster doesn't have any built-in auditing tools, it would be beneficial to have events for the priority change.

Following events would be emitted:

* `task-priority-changed` with `taskId`, `existingPriority` and `newPriority`
* `task-group-priority-changed` with `taskGroupId`, `newPriority`

When the task group priority is changed, the event will be emitted for each task in the group additionally.

### New scopes

This will also require introduction of the new scopes (anyOf):

* `queue:change-task-priority-in-queue:<taskQueueId>`
* `queue:change-task-priority:<taskId>`
* `queue:lower-task-priority:<taskId>` to only allow lowering the priority
* `queue:raise-task-priority:<taskId>` to only allow raising the priority

And for task group:

* `queue:change-task-group-priority:<schedulerId>/<taskGroupId>` (for consistency with existing task group scopes)
* `queue:lower-task-group-priority:<taskGroupId>` to only allow lowering the priority
* `queue:raise-task-group-priority:<taskGroupId>` to only allow raising the priority

### Priority calculation

Current order for picking up tasks is based on the task priority and insertion time (FIFO).
This RFC proposes to change the priority only, and leave the insertion time as is.
